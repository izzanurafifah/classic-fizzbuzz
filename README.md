# Classic Fizzbuzz

## Overview
A simple Python implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem.

## Problem Statement
The problem is to print the numbers from 1 to 100. However, there are specific rules for certain multiples:
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
